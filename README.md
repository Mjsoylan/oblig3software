i add a workflow with github actions
i change some of the code so it works with gradle and chosies the test in my file and have testen when i change files so it will fail if the test fail but be succsefull if they succsed too
and as you see in the actions log you see the test works, github shows when they fail and succede and when you go to the build you see whitch test failed or succeded
